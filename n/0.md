    Every day is same

# 0

nâ€™ = 0

The first dimension is t, 0 represents the instantaneous concept of "now".

0 also means [Kakutani fixed point theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/KakutanisFixedPointTheorem.html)

In my generalized game theory, 0 is called a temporal fixed point.
But I prefer call it [time series zero point](https://www.zeusro.com/2025/08/22/zero/).
