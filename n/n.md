# n

n is the n-dimensional world based on time series.

## n=1

```go

type N struct {
	Sky
	Ground
	YoungAndBeautiful 
	Others
}

```

Kubernetes is a database.

## n≠1

![image](1=N.svg)

n ≠ 1 is just a special case of xyz.  
When t = 0, 1 = 1 and 0 = 0 ⇒ n = 1 ∧ n ≠ 1.

n = 1, 1 = n reflects a bidirectional idea from subset to superset.
Vice versa.

## 1=n

![image](n.webp)

Kubernetes is a distributed system.

Building on 1D, layering all time series forms a time-based river of history: *1 = n*.

## Deduction

From 1=n, n=1, we can derive the mathematical axiom of n-dimensional space:

1. The traditional three-dimensional (n<=3, where n is the n of the "current rectangular coordinate system") world operation rules are the special state at t=0
1. 0 moves to t.0↗️R0↗️R1↗️R2↗️R3↗️n
1. As time changes,n↘️R3↘️R2↘️R1↘️R0↘️0
