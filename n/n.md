# n

n is the n-dimensional world based on time series.

## n=1

```go

type N struct {
	Sky
	Ground
	YoungAndBeautiful 
	Others
}

```

n is universe.
“Compress” all data to 1.
So n=1.

## n≠1

![image](1=N.svg)

So many people.

n≠1 is a special case in xyz.

```
1:𝑑𝑛⧸𝑑𝑡 = 0
2:t = 0
3:1 = 1 && 0 = 0 && x=x && y=y && z=z
4:n≠1
```

## 1=n

Kubernetes is a distributed system.

Building on 1D, layering all time series forms a time-based river of history: *1 = n*.

For example,so many people,they are all human.

n = 1 ⟺ 1 = n,it reflects a bidirectional idea from subset to superset.
Vice versa.

## Deduction

From 1=n ⟺ n=1, we can derive the mathematical axiom of n-dimensional space:

1. The traditional three-dimensional (n<=3, where n is the n of the "rectangular coordinate system") world operation rules are the special state when t=0
1. 0 moves to t.0↗️R0↗️R1↗️R2↗️R3↗️n
1. As time changes,n↘️R3↘️R2↘️R1↘️R0↘️0

0 → t → • → ― → ▭ → ▣

- $0 \in \mathbb{R}^0$
- $time \subset \mathbb{R}^1$
- $Point \in \mathbb{R}^2$
- $Line \in \mathbb{R}^3$
- $Surface \subset \mathbb{R}^4$
- $3D \subset \mathbb{R}^5$
- $n \subset \mathbb{R}^n+1$
