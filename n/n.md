# n

n is the n-dimensional world based on time series.

## n=1

```go
type N struct {
	Sky
	Ground
	YoungAndBeautiful 
	Others
}
```

Kubernetes is a database.


## n≠1

![image](1=N.svg)

n ≠ 1 is just a special case of xyz.  
When t = 0, 1 = 1 and 0 = 0 ⇒ n = 1 ∧ n ≠ 1.

n = 1, 1 = n reflects a bidirectional idea from subset to superset.
Vice versa.

## 1=n

Kubernetes is a distributed system.

Building on 1D, layering all time series forms a time-based river of history: *1 = n*.

## Deduction

From 1=n, n=1, we can derive the mathematical axiom of n-dimensional space:
1. The traditional three-dimensional (n<=3, where n is the n of the "current rectangular coordinate system") world operation rules are the special state at t=0
1. 

0 moves to t, as time changes, points move to lines, lines move to surfaces, surfaces move to volumes, volumes move to dimensions
0↗️t.As time changes,point↗️lines↗️surfaces↗️volumes

```

- $P \in \mathbb{R}^0$
- $L \subset \mathbb{R}^1$
- $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$
- $V \subset \mathbb{R}^3$
- $\dim = n$
```

由1=n，n=1可以得出n维空间数学公理：
1. 传统三维（n<=3，这里的n是“当前直角坐标系”的n）世界运算法则是t=0时的特殊态；
1. 0动成t，随着时间变化，点动成线，线动成面，面动成体，体动成维；
1. 推论：随着时间变化，维降成体，体缩成面，面揉成线，线压成点，点灭为0。
