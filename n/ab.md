# N-Dimensional ab

## Easy To Understand

In 3D space, ab is shortest in the XYZ orthogonal system.

But because time and space are "curved" (the earth is round).

For example,Fat Tiger stands in front of you and asks for protection money, so you can only "go around" him.
So, you end up walking along a “curve.”

However, this "curve" takes the shortest time, so it is actually also a 4-dimensional "line segment".

## Fully Dynamic Walking

    The shortest segment between two points is the one with the least time cost;

xyz plus time,add surrounding objects,form a generalized n-dimensional world.

Then the n-dimensional line segment, this "straight line", appears to be very vague and curved in traditional three-dimensional creatures, but in fact it is the n-dimensional line segment that appears in a reduced dimension in three-dimensional space.

Fully Dynamic Walking is the best policy in the walking problem.

Try not to touch others, because Pareto optimization cannot harm others.
